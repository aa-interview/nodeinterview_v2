## Test your creativity!

They saw Rome was not built in a day but we have heard that you have a reputation of building amazing things overnight!
So, what can you build in a couple days using just an API call. Let's find out!

## Situation:
You are the CTO of an airline company serving a regional Asian market. Natural disasters happen and you need to learn how to adapt!

In Nov 2017, Mt. Agung in Bali, Indonesia has disrupted AirAsia flights for days. Find a way to keep the aircraft flying as up-to-date as possible using data from the Volcanic Ash Asdvisory Centre (VAAC).


## Prerequisites:
1. MVP must be built on a Node stack
2. Frontend framework optional and entirely up to you
3. Get creative!

### Submission Guidelines:
1. MVC must be built on a Node stack
2. Git commit and push your application on the day after the interview 
3. Deploying the application to a test environment (eg: Heroku, GCP, AWS) will gain you an advantage

### Tips:
1. Look closely at the API response. Theres lots of data embedded in it. How can we use it to our benefit?
2. Think ahead - The nature of asynchronous applications enables us to run concurrent functions. How can we avoid callback hell? 
3. Be economical - In an enterprise scenario; cost saving measures often require developers to 'recycle' existing information; how would you minimize calls to the VAAC API?
4. Less is more - Prefer to 'hack' your own module rather than rely on a package? Sure, why not! 
5. Be practical! Updates need to be timely and fast! Devise a plan to keep users of the service updated and can see a history of changes.
