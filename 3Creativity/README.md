## Test your creativity!

They saw Rome was not built in a day but we have heard that you have a reputation of building amazing things overnight!
So, what can you build in a day using just an API call. Let's find out!

## Situation:
You are the CTO of an ecommerce company serving a global market. The shareholders of the company could like you to come up with a solution to maximize profits using international forex rates.

Your database of products are in the product.json file.

## Prerequisites:
1. MVP must be built on a Node stack
2. Frontend framework optional and entirely up to you
3. Get creative!

### Submission Guidelines:
1. MVC must be built on a Node stack
2. Git commit and push your application on the day after the interview 
3. Deploying the application to a test environment (eg: Heroku) will gain you an advantage

### Tips:
1. Look closely at the API response. Theres lots of data embedded in it. How can we use it to our benefit?
2. Think ahead - The nature of asynchronous applications enables us to run concurrent functions. How can we avoid callback hell? 
3. Be economical - In an enterprise scenario; cost saving measures often require developers to 'recycle' existing information; how would you minimize calls to the Currency Converter API?
4. Less is more - Prefer to 'hack' your own module rather than rely on a package? Sure, why not! 
5. Be secure! - Careless developers could jeapordise the entire company simply by leaving hardcoded access keys as parameters in function code!
